# Laravel 5 JSON API Mappings on top of Dingo

This package makes [Laravel 5 JSON API Server Package](https://github.com/nilportugues/laravel5-jsonapi)  and [Dingo](https://github.com/dingo/api) play well together by using Dingo's API routing system instead of Laravel's.

By doing this you get the automatic formatting of the JSON API mappings and the versioning and security offered by Dingo.
